```

## Exposed data

The following tasmota data is supported

- ON/OFF state
- Current and total power consumption for power meter devices
- COÂ² levels for [MH-Z19 sensors](https://tasmota.github.io/docs/MH-Z19B/)
- Power and Gas levels from [supported P1 smart meters](https://tasmota.github.io/docs/Smart-Meter-Interface/)

## Xiaomi MI Temperature and Humidity Sensors

Tasmota can expose temperature and humidity data from Xiaomi sensors, to expose these sensors you need to configure the names for the sensors.

This is done by setting the `MITEMP_NAMES` environment variable to comma separated key value pairs of the last 6 digits
of the MAC address of the sensors and the desired name.

```dotenv
MITEMP_NAMES="351234=Bedroom,352468=Living Room"
```
